# Rock-Paper-Scissors

#Instructions:

Make a rock, paper, scissors game.

Learning outcomes:

How you will store the user's input.
How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
And also how you will give feedback to the player.
You can find the "official" rules of the game on the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.

Debugging challenge
Try running this code and type 5.

It will give you an IndexError and point to line 32 as the issue.

But on line 38 we are trying to prevent a crash by detecting any numbers great than or equal to 3 or less than 0.
